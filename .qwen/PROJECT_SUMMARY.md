# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a comprehensive Genshin Impact Card Game (七圣召唤) deck builder system with advanced filtering, search capabilities, and UI enhancements

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Flask backend with Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- **Data Sources**: card_data/*.json files containing character, equipment, event, and support cards
- **Core Files**: `/Users/wonder/bindolabs/ys_qs/api/deck_builder.py` contains the main deck builder functionality
- **Build/Run**: Use `uv run python` to execute Python scripts
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/deck-builder` - main deck builder page
  - `/api/cards/filter` - card filtering with search and filters
  - `/api/deck/validate` - deck validation
  - `/api/characters/filters` - character filter options
  - `/api/cards/tags` - available card tags
