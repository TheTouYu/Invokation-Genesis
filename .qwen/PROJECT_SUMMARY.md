# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a complete Genshin Impact Card Game (七圣召唤) implementation with backend services, authentication, game logic, and frontend components following a structured 12-week development plan.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python Flask backend, React frontend, SQLAlchemy ORM, JWT authentication, Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support
- **Architecture**: REST API with WebSocket support for multiplayer, modular models for game entities, dataclass-based game models
- **File Structure**: Models in `/models/`, API endpoints in `/api/`, game engine in `/game_engine/`, frontend in `/frontend/`
- **Database**: SQLite for development (planned to switch to PostgreSQL), with User, CardData, Deck, GameHistory models
- **Build Commands**: `uv run python app.py` to start server, `npm start` for frontend, `bash test_auth.sh` for auth testing
- **Data Models**: Uses dataclasses with proper inheritance and default value ordering to prevent Python "non-default argument follows default argument" error
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - Public: `/health`, `/api/test`
  - Authenticated: `/api/cards`, `/api/cards/characters`, `/api/cards/events`, `/api/decks`, `/api/local-game`
- **Game Engine**: State machine-driven game flow controller handling rounds (roll, action, end phases), action processing, cost payment, and win conditions
- **Testing**: Complete integration testing with `integration_test_final.py` and `run_integration_test.sh`

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Fixed Flask-SQLAlchemy initialization issues by creating an `init_models_db` function
- [DONE] Resolved dataclass parameter ordering issues in game_models.py to prevent Python "non-default argument follows default argument" error
- [DONE] Completed phase 1.3: Project skeleton setup with proper directory structure, routing, and game engine core
- [DONE] Implemented game engine core functionality including state management, phase control, action processing, and cost payment system
- [DONE] Implemented card and game APIs with endpoints for card data, deck management, and local game functionality
- [DONE] Imported 519 cards (121 characters, 104 events, 226 equipment, 68 supports) from JSON files to database
- [DONE] Created comprehensive API test page accessible at `/api/test`
- [DONE] Developed complete integration testing suite with automatic card group creation logic
- [DONE] Fixed API route issues (changed `<int:deck_id>` to `<deck_id>` for UUID support)
- [DONE] All API endpoints tested and verified working with 519 imported cards

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up database models and basic API endpoints
2. [DONE] Implement user authentication system with JWT
3. [DONE] Create authentication API endpoints and test them
4. [DONE] Resolve Flask-SQLAlchemy initialization issues
5. [DONE] Complete phase 1.3: Project skeleton setup
6. [DONE] Complete phase 2.1: Single player game mode - Game Engine Core
7. [DONE] Complete phase 2.2: Single player game mode - Card and Game APIs
8. [DONE] Import card data and create API test page
9. [DONE] Create integration test suite
10. [TODO] Continue with phase 2: Single player game mode complete
11. [TODO] Implement WebSocket communication system for multiplayer (Phase 3)
12. [TODO] Create React frontend components and Redux store
