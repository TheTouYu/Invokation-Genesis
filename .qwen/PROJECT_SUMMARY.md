# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Refactor and standardize the Genshin Impact Card Game (七圣召唤) backend API to eliminate duplicate endpoints, establish a single source of truth for card data using database storage, and implement proper JWT authentication.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Flask-based web application with SQLAlchemy ORM, using JWT for authentication
- **Architecture**: Standardized data pipeline from source files through data processing to database storage and API returns
- **Data Sources**: Previously inconsistent sources (webpage scraping, JSON files, database) now unified to use database as single source of truth
- **File Structure**: 
  - `data_pipeline.py` - handles webpage scraping and JSON file creation
  - `database_importer.py` - imports JSON data to database with delayed model loading
  - `utils/card_data_processor.py` - unified data processing module
  - `api/standardized_cards.py` - standardized API endpoints
  - `api/deck_builder/api_routes.py` - updated to use database source instead of files
- **Database Models**: CardData, User, Deck, GameHistory with lazy initialization through `init_models_db()`
- **API Structure**: "Source Files → Data Processing → Database → API Returns" pipeline
- **Testing**: Pytest-based testing framework with SQLite in-memory databases for isolation

## Recent Actions
1. [DONE] Identified and removed duplicate API endpoints between `api/deck_builder/api_routes.py` and `api/standardized_cards.py`
2. [DONE] Restored JWT authentication decorators on all endpoints in `api/standardized_cards.py` that had been commented out
3. [DONE] Removed redundant card management endpoints from `api/deck_builder/api_routes.py` that were duplicating functionality in the standardized API
4. [DONE] Fixed test framework database connection issues and unique constraint conflicts
5. [DONE] Updated authentication, deck, and card API tests to use UUID-based unique usernames/emails to prevent SQLite unique constraint violations
6. [DONE] Successfully verified that core API tests now pass (21 tests passing)

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze duplicate API endpoints between `api/deck_builder/api_routes.py` and `api/standardized_cards.py`
2. [DONE] Check which API endpoints in `standardized_cards.py` have JWT authentication enabled
3. [DONE] Identify duplicate endpoints that should be removed from `deck_builder/api_routes.py`
4. [DONE] Remove redundant endpoints from `deck_builder/api_routes.py`
5. [DONE] Update the template to use the correct standardized API endpoints
6. [DONE] Fix test framework database connection issues preventing test execution
7. [DONE] Update auth_api, deck_api, and standardized_cards_api tests to avoid user creation conflicts
8. [DONE] Verify all fixed tests pass successfully
9. [TODO] Address remaining test failures in other test files (integration tests, game engine tests)
10. [TODO] Complete documentation for the standardized API endpoints for frontend integration
11. [TODO] Create deployment scripts for the refactored system
12. [TODO] Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the pipeline
