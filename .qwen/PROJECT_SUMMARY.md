# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a complete Genshin Impact Card Game (七圣召唤) implementation with backend services, authentication, game logic, and frontend components following a structured 12-week development plan.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python Flask backend, React frontend, SQLAlchemy ORM, JWT authentication
- **Architecture**: REST API with WebSocket support for multiplayer, modular models for game entities
- **File Structure**: Models in /models/, API endpoints in /api/, frontend in /frontend/
- **Database**: SQLite for development (planned to switch to PostgreSQL), with User, CardData, Deck, GameHistory models
- **Build Commands**: `uv run python app.py` to start server, `bash test_auth.sh` for auth testing

## Recent Actions
- Completed phase 1.2 of development plan: User authentication system
- Implemented user registration, login, and profile APIs in api/auth.py
- Created proper database models with relationships in models/db_models.py
- Fixed Flask-SQLAlchemy circular import issues by creating an init_models_db function
- Successfully tested authentication functionality with JWT tokens
- Addressed several runtime errors related to database initialization

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up database models and basic API endpoints
2. [DONE] Implement user authentication system with JWT
3. [DONE] Create authentication API endpoints and test them
4. [IN PROGRESS] Resolve Flask-SQLAlchemy initialization issues
5. [TODO] Continue with phase 1.3: Game engine core implementation
6. [TODO] Implement WebSocket communication system for multiplayer
7. [TODO] Create React frontend components and Redux store
